<p>Some of my achievements in life include winning a competition during Nutrition Month in elementary school.<br> I also participated in different contestsâ€”even though I didn't win most of them,<br>
 I'm proud that I tried. In high school, I joined various school events and volunteered as a class officer during Grade 10.<br>
That's all. If I were to summarize my achievements, I'd say they may seem small, but they are meaningful to me.</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Ayen Chyde L. Atienza from Grade 12 - Pintaflores.<br>
I was born in Norzagaray, Bulacan, and I grew up in Caloocan City.<br>
My father's name is Jay Russel G. Atienza, and my mother's name is Irene Atienza.
<br>When I was 8 years old, my parents and I moved to Bulacan to help my grandmother lead our barangay.<br>
 After five years, we moved back to Caloocan to pursue a better life.<br>
I graduated from Old Barrio Elementary School and completed my junior high school at Deparo High School.</p><br>
